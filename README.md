This code package implements various types of adversarial attacks on deep learning models for wind power forecasting from the paper "Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Wind Power Forecasts" by Ren√© Heinrich* (Fraunhofer IEE, University of Kassel), Stephan Vogt (University of Kassel), Malte Lehna (Fraunhofer IEE, University of Kassel), and Christoph Scholz (Fraunhofer IEE, University of Kassel).
(* denotes corresponding author).
In particular, we studied the vulnerability of two different forecasting models to targeted, semi-targeted, and untargeted adversarial attacks. 
The first model was a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for forecasting the power production of individual wind farms. 
The second model was a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for forecasting wind power generation across Germany.

## Setup
All requirements are listed in `requirements.txt`. They can be installed via
```{python}
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data
The LSTM model used wind speed forecasts for a single wind farm in the form of a univariate time series as input data. 
The target values represented the wind power measurements of the wind farm. 
For the robustness evaluation of the LSTM model, the wind speed and wind power data of 10 wind farms were used from the [GEFCom2014 dataset](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169207016000133), which is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pqenrr2mcvl0hk9/GEFCom2014.zip?dl=0).

The CNN model used wind speed forecasts for all of Germany in the form of weather maps as input data. 
The target values represented the total wind power generation in Germany. 
For the CNN model, the wind speed forecasts of the [ICON-EU model](https://www.dwd.de/DWD/forschung/nwv/fepub/icon_database_main.pdf) of the German Weather Service (DWD) were used, which are available [here](https://opendata.dwd.de/weather/nwp/icon-eu/). 
Data on wind power generation in Germany were obtained from the ENTSO-E website and can be downloaded [here](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/generation/r2/actualGenerationPerProductionType/show). 
For the experiments, these wind power measurements were normalized by the installed wind power capacity in Germany, which is available [here](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/generation/r2/installedGenerationCapacityAggregation/show).
